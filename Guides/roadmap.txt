## 🧭 Project Roadmap: Mini Militia PC Clone (2D Multiplayer Shooter)

### 🔧 1. **Project Setup**
- Set up a clean folder structure.
- Initialize `requirements.txt`.
- Create virtual environment and install dependencies.
- Copy real-time backend/frontend communication code from your previous project.

### 📁 2. **Organize Project Structure**
```

```

---

### 🧱 3. **Backend (WebSocket Server)**
- Setup Django + Channels
- Create `GameConsumer` (WebSocket handling logic)
- Maintain in-memory player state (position, health, etc.)
- Implement:
  - connect/disconnect
  - broadcast updates
  - attack logic (maybe later)

---

### 🎮 4. **Frontend (Pygame Game Client)**
- Create a simple 2D player entity
- Capture keyboard/mouse input
- Send position to server via WebSocket
- Render all player positions from server
- Collision/physics if needed

---

### 🔁 5. **Real-Time Communication**
- Player moves → send (x, y) to server
- Server broadcasts all player states
- Game loop receives and renders updates in real-time

---

### 🔫 6. **Core Gameplay Mechanics**
- Movement
- Shooting (directional bullets)
- Health & respawn system
- Simple map (platforms/walls)

---

### 🌐 7. **Multiplayer Handling**
- Unique player IDs
- Spawn logic (avoid overlap)
- Synchronize latency & delay handling

---

### 📦 8. **Optimization & Cleanup**
- Use delta timing for consistent movement
- Limit updates to 30Hz or similar
- Clear disconnected players
- Logs + debugging tools

---

### 🚀 9. **Testing & Demo**
- Test with 2 clients on localhost
- Later: LAN/WAN testing (port forwarding or Hamachi/ZeroTier)
- Record or export a working demo

---

### 📋 10. **Future Improvements**
- Multiple weapons
- Animations
- Power-ups
- Team mode
- Map editor

---
